          <h2>What is F#</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          F# is a functional programming language that makes it easy to write
          correct and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          F# programming primarily involves defining types and functions that
          are type-inferred and generalized automatically. This allows your
          focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data,
          rather than the details of programming.

          <h2>Introduction to Functional Programming in F#</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the
          use of functions and immutable data. Typed functional programming is
          when functional programming is combined with static types, such as
          with F#. In general, the following concepts are emphasized in
          functional programming:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functions as the primary constructs you use</li>
          <li>Expressions instead of statements</li>
          <li>Immutable values over variables</li>
          <li>Declarative programming over imperative programming</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>

        <p>
          Functional programming, like other programming paradigms, comes with a
          vocabulary that you will eventually need to learn. Here are some
          common terms you'll see all of the time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Function</strong> - A function is a construct that will
            produce an output when given an input. More formally, it maps an
            item from one set to another set. This formalism is lifted into the
            concrete in many ways, especially when using functions that operate
            on collections of data. It is the most basic (and important) concept
            in functional programming.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expression</strong> - An expression is a construct in code
            that produces a value. In F#, this value must be bound or explicitly
            ignored. An expression can be trivially replaced by a function call.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purity</strong> - Purity is a property of a function such
            that its return value is always the same for the same arguments, and
            that its evaluation has no side effects. A pure function depends
            entirely on its arguments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Referential Transparency</strong> - Referential Transparency
            is a property of expressions such that they can be replaced with
            their output without affecting a program's behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Immutability</strong> - Immutability means that a value
            cannot be changed in-place. This is in contrast with variables,
            which can change in place.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Async programming in F#</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Asynchronous programming is a mechanism that is essential to modern
          applications for diverse reasons. There are two primary use cases that
          most developers will encounter:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Presenting a server process that can service a significant number of
            concurrent incoming requests, while minimizing the system resources
            occupied while request processing awaits inputs from systems or
            services external to that process
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintaining a responsive UI or main thread while concurrently
            progressing background work
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although background work often does involve the utilization of
          multiple threads, it's important to consider the concepts of
          asynchrony and multi-threading separately. In fact, they are separate
          concerns, and one does not imply the other. This article describes the
          separate concepts in more detail.
        </p>
        <h3>Asynchrony defined</h3>

        <p>
          The previous point - that asynchrony is independent of the utilization
          of multiple threads - is worth explaining a bit further. There are
          three concepts that are sometimes related, but strictly independent of
          one another:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Concurrency; when multiple computations execute in overlapping time
            periods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parallelism; when multiple computations or several parts of a single
            computation run at exactly the same time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Asynchrony; when one or more computations can execute separately
            from the main program flow.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All three are orthogonal concepts, but can be easily conflated,
          especially when they are used together. For example, you may need to
          execute multiple asynchronous computations in parallel. This
          relationship does not mean that parallelism or asynchrony imply one
          another.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you consider the etymology of the word "asynchronous", there are
          two pieces involved:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"a", meaning "not".</li>
          <li>"synchronous", meaning "at the same time".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you put these two terms together, you'll see that "asynchronous"
          means "not at the same time". That's it! There is no implication of
          concurrency or parallelism in this definition. This is also true in
          practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          In practical terms, asynchronous computations in F# are scheduled to
          execute independently of the main program flow. This independent
          execution doesn't imply concurrency or parallelism, nor does it imply
          that a computation always happens in the background. In fact,
          asynchronous computations can even execute synchronously, depending on
          the nature of the computation and the environment the computation is
          executing in.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main takeaway you should have is that asynchronous computations
          are independent of the main program flow. Although there are few
          guarantees about when or how an asynchronous computation executes,
          there are some approaches to orchestrating and scheduling them. The
          rest of this article explores core concepts for F# asynchrony and how
          to use the types, functions, and expressions built into F#.
